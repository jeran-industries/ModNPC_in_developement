Removal of Data¶
Automatic removal¶
If requested by the member through the bot data removal function, the data will be reseted. This only applies on the user who requested this and not on other accounts by the same user. 
If the user requests it, no data will ever be collected from the user. To do this the userid will be saved one last time to save the decision of the member.

Manual removal¶
Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at jeran-industries@proton.me.
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
