webdashboard:
1.  Frontend:   User opens website, authenticate and select server 
    Backend:    After receiving userid and guildid, the setup for the guild gets locked in the main database and guild specific database get sended to the loading yew.rs app
2.  Frontend:   User makes changes in the yew.rs app
    Backend:    The branched database gets modified
3.  Frontend:   User ends session
    Backend:    The main database gets synced with the branched database from the yew.rs app

Possible to throw user out of setup to evade locks bez of not closing the tab and other changes
